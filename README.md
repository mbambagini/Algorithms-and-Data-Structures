# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mbambagini/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mbambagini/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures)

this repository contains several examples I wrote to make practise with Algorithms and Data Structures.

Data structures:
* single-linked list (list.cc)
* double-linked list (double_list.cc)
* stack (stack.cc)
* queue (queue.cc)
* deque: double-ended queue (deque.cc)
* heap (heap.cc)
* tree (tree.cc)
* trie (trie.cc)
* hash (hash.cc)
* graph
  * based on adjacency matrix (graph_matrix.cc)
  * based on adjacency list (graph_list.cc)

Algorithms:
* sorting (sorting.cc): selection sort, insertion sort, shell sort, bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort and heap sort
* searching (search.cc): indexed-key search, sequential search, binary search and binary search tree (BST)
* Dijkstra's algorithm (dijkstra.cc)

Other files:
* examples: solutions of several additional problems of "Cracking the Coding Interview" (5th Edition)
* others: other exercises found on Google
* script to execute all tests (run.sh)
* documentation (README.md)
