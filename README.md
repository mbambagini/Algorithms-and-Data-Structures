# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

this repository contains several examples I wrote to make practise with Algorithms and Data Structures.

Data structures:
* single-linked list (list.cc)
* double-linked list (double_list.cc)
* stack (stack.cc)
* queue (queue.cc)
* deque: double-ended queue (deque.cc)
* heap (heap.cc)
* tree (tree.cc)
* graph
  * based on adjacency matrix (graph_matrix.cc)
  * based on adjacency list (graph_list.cc)

Algorithms:
* sorting (sorting.cc): selection sort, insertion sort, shell sort, bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort and heap sort

Other files:
* script to execute all tests (run.sh)
* documentation (README.md)

For more information, see "Algorithms in C++" as reference
